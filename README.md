# Alzheimer's Disease Gene Expression Analysis
This project uses RNA-seq count data (GSE153873) to identify differentially expressed genes between Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Old, and Young samples. 

### ðŸ”¬ Methods
- STAR count matrix
- DESeq2 differential expression analysis
- Pathway enrichment using Enrichr (KEGG 2021 Human)
- Visualization and interpretation of top genes and pathways

### Key Findings
- CRH downregulated in AD (stress-related)
- TNF, RAGE signaling, LTD, and CAMs are altered in AD brains
